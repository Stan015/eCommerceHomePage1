# eCommerceHomePage1
This is my first eCommerce homepage built using HTML and CSS. It use to be a UI design I made some time ago, but it is now lines of code and I am happy with my progress.

It is a page with other sub-pages leading to other parts of the business pages for easy and fun choice shopping. However, this repository contains only the homepage and I built it with the intent of perfecting my _HTML_ and _CSS_ knowledge so far.

I designed this very UI some months ago using figma. My designing skills had boosted my confidence to embark on the road map to becoming an expert _FrontEnd Dev_ with time of constant practice and learning.
